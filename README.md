# PaintSharp

## Description

PaintSharp is my own version of Windows Paint, written in C# with .NET 6 and WPF. I wrote it as side project to test my C#, WPF and working with graphics skills.

## How to setup PaintSharp?
### What do I need to install PaintSharp?
Everything you need is just .NET 6.0 Runtime, in case you don't have it already installed. PaintSharp is only avaible for Windows (7/8/10/11).

### How to install PaintSharp?
In this GitHub repo you can download any release you want. The most recommended is of corse the latest one. Just fo to [Releases Page](https://github.com/Iwaneq/PaintSharp/releases) and download Setup.exe. Application should download after you open this file. It may take couple of minutes and it's worth pointing out, that installation happens in background, so you'll don't see any installation wizards.  

When installation will end successfully, PaintSharp icon will appear on your desktop.
